# Retrospective	

What worked well: 

- Worked together to agree on technical processes
- Stuck together as a group from the beginning, and when we pivoted, it was with unity.
- We adapted to circumstances very well.
- No one particular ego dominated 
- Ideas were discussed openly and frankly
- Gave interpersonal feedback about working dynamic
- Committed frequently, without many bad conflicts



What could be improved:

- We could have been more organized about timing
- We could have asked for help sooner
- We could have made sure everyone was up to date in terms of code and process
- Needed to peer-review code before submission
- Could have been more commited to getting owners for particular tasks and having those owners see the task through
- Could have written more granular action stories - get more granularity than pages and process, and focus on functions and methods
- Sleep more



What will we commit to doing in the next sprint:

- Write more granular action items
- Plan work-flow better
